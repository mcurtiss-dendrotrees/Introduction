# Hi, I'm Megan 👋

Graduate student in Geography and Environmental Systems at UMBC, specializing in spatial analysis, hydrologic modeling, and urban forestry research. My thesis research involves
long term monitoring of intra-annual stem growth with dendrometer bands installed on a sample of trees (n=99) on the UMBC campus. 

I am finishing my program in Spring 2026 and currently seeking a full time position in urban forestry. My interests extend beyond trees, into surrounding ecosystems and built environments. Moreover, I am passionate about creating long term connections between communities and green spaces, in all of their various forms - to help create climate resilience at local scales guided by community-based leadership and scientific evidence.


## 🔧 Technical Skills
- **GIS:** ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, spatial analysis, terrain modeling
- **Programming:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, spatial packages)
- **Analysis:** Hydrologic modeling, watershed analysis, statistical analysis
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, TauDEM

## 🌱 Current Projects
Working on my Master's thesis examining tree growth responses to urban microclimate and hydrologic conditions.
